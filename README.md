# cl-fring

Some tools for my personal research of a particular near-ring over free groups. Since concatenation (which serves as the addition in free groups) is non-commutative, the multiplication is only distributive *on the right*, hence it's a near-ring, although it does contain isomorphisms of the ring of integers as subrings.

For simplicity of coding, the generator set of symbols is for the time being represented as numbers.
